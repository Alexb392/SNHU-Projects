# SNHU-Projects
1.
Q: Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
A: In this project I set out to create a working banking system that could log and process data input by the user.
For this project I was acting as an employee working at the fictional company Chada, where I needed to create a working
banking app for another fictional company called Airgead Banking. Airgead needed me to create a working banking app that
would track investiments and show how they would grow over a certain time period.

Q: What did you do particularly well?
A: I think the best thing I did well was programming the math for the inputs. It wasn't perfect and I know there are a few 
errors but it was a large hurdle for me and I think I did good for my skill level. The menu was deffinelty the smothest but 
I feel that it was relatively easy so I am much more proud of the math. 
3.
Q: Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
A: I think the best thing I could do to enhance my code is to fix the errors with the math. I feel thats the most obviouse thing,
but I think I could also make the menu look a big nicer, and I could also lessen the amount of code in int main. I could probably
just keep the menu in there and create something else for the math.
4.
Q: Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you 
adding to your support network?
A: as mentioned before, I think the think I found the most challengeing was getting the math to work. I had make a few forum posts on 
places like stack overflow and reddit and I was able to get a lot of answers to my questions on those sites. I also found some really great
Youtube channels that have great information and little projects that they show you how to programm
5.
Q: What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
A: Creating menus was a good skill that I had roughly developed during this project. I find it fairly simple to design simple menus
and I have even found a better way to create them. Something somewhat unrelated to programming specificaly I learned was doing research
on problems that I encountered. I came across a lot of really helpful communities while I was working on this and other projects 
which really opened my eyes to how nice and open the programmming community is. 
6.
Q: How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
A: Like with my other projects I had to comment the code I wrote and I feel that I am getting better at this, but I think I still need
to work on abbreviateing things and just learning the acronyms and shorthands of things are, just so I can make it a bit easier and quicker
to read.
